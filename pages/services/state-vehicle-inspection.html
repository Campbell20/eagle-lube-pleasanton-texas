            <h2>Texas State Inspection at Eagle Lube</h2>
           Texas requires all registered vehicles to be inspected annually. Inspections are performed to ensure the safety of all motorist. Texas has recently updated their protocol for state vehicle inspections. Motorist will no longer receive at state inspection sticker at the time of inspection, as your vehicle's inspection will be tied to your vehicle's registration. This is known as the Two Steps One Sticker initiative. Eagle Lube has a certified state inspector on location to promptly perform state inspection services. Eagle Lube can perform an annual state inspection for any passenger vehicle, motorcycle, or trailer. If you are a current resident or new to town, the Eagle can handle your annual state inspection.
